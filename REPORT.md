## Lession Learned

During this project, we had learned and practicing a lot of aspects of product development. Before we came to this class, most of us are not knowing a lot of functionalties that how to develope a real android application through *Android Studo*. But now we had created a small and simple appliction which is really can be used. 
* We learned how to using the Github as a group. 
* We learned to use the Firebase as database to saving user data.
* We learned to burliding/updating the APK for app.
* We learned to writing the simple local unit tests to testing our local methods.

We learned that how to coorpearating with each other as a group. We overcomed the problems that we had make at deliverable #1, such as the conflicts and repition of codes, how to distrubuted the work evenly. We ensured everyone had a role, then we were working more effciently as a goroup. We learned more useful method that help implement new function.
